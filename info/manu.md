Energy-Saving Operation

## TDM (Time-Division Multi) Variables (TDM product Only)

```
Press the button, press the , or , button to select Priority A2A, and then press the button.
Setting FSV #5033 to '0' becomes 'Priority A2A', and setting to '1' becomes 'Priority DHW'.
```

- Under the installation of both A2A (Air-To-Air type air conditioner) and A2W (Air-To-Water type hydro
  unit) at the same time, our outdoor machine can supply its full capacity to the operating indoor
  machines (including A2A or A2W). If there are simultaneous operating demands from many A2A
  machines with A2W, the priority of controlling the outdoor machine (ex: compressor frequency) will be
  given to A2A, because of their fast response for use’s comfort. Only the remaining capacity of outdoor
  machine will be given to A2W during A2A’s normal operation. In this case, it might take very long time
  for A2W heating, so the outdoor machine will alternate the controlling priorities between A2A and A2W
  with time basis.
- Priority maximum ope ration time (at FSV #5033=0): FSV #5031 (Default 30 min., Range 10 ~ 90 min.),
  After elapsing A2A maximum time, the outdoor machine will operate only for A2W to speed up the A2W’s
  heating/cooling performance, even though there are A2A’s continuous operation demands.
- Non priority minimum operation time (at FSV #5033=0): FSV #5032(Default 5 min., Range 3 ~ 60 min.),
  in this minimum time, the outdoor machine will operate only for A2W, even though there are no more
  A2W’s continuous operation demands.

- When the remote controller is used, floor valve should be connected to zone #1 and the FCU valve should
  be separately connected to zone #2 of the Hydro Unit PBA.
- When only floor cooling/heating is installed and if the Water Law or outlet water temperature is too low,
  2way valve may closed and E911 error may occur.
- When the floor and FCU units are installed together and operating in cooling mode, floor valve may close
  and E911 may occur to prevent floor condensation when the outlet water temperature is below 16°C.
  Therefore FCU should secure minimum value for the flow rate.
- Thermostat #2 which controls FCU has the priority for operation modes and the discharge water
  temperature.
- Samsung is not responsible for the accidents such as floor condensations which can occur by not
  connecting the valve to the zone #1 port of the Hydro Unit PBA.

DHW Heating : Code 30\*\*

DHW Application

The FSV #3011 in the wired remote controller should be set to 1 or 2 to use DHW function.

If FSV #3011 is set to 1, the DHW operation starts based on the thermo on temperature.
If FSV #3011 is set to 2, the DHW operation starts based on the thermo off temperature.

(For example, when the current temperature becomes 45°C under the conditions that the thermo on
temperature is 43°C and the thermo off temperature is 48°C, the DHW turns off if FSV #3011 is set to 1 and
DHW turns on if FSV #3011 is set to 2.)

Heat Pump Variables for Controlling DHW Tank

- Maximum DHW tank temperature with R-410A(refrigerant) heat pump operation :
  FSV #3021, Default 55/63/70°C, Range : 45 ~ 55/63/70°C.
- Temperature difference determining the heat pump OFF temperature :
  FSV #3022, Range : 0 ~ 10°C.
- Temperature difference determining the heat pump ON temperature :
  FSV #3023, Default 5°C, Range : 5 ~ 30°C.

- The FSV #3031 should be set to "1(On)" (Default) to use booster heater as an additional heat source for
  DHW tank.
- Booster heater startup delay timer : In case of DHW request, this timer will delay the operation of
  booster heater compared to heat pump.
  ‒ FS V #3032 (Default 20 min., Range 20 ~ 95 min.), In "Power/Forced" DHW mode, the delay timer will
  be neglected, and the booster starts immediately.
  ‒ In "Economic" DHW mode, the DHW heating will be conducted only with heat pump.
  ‒ #3032 should be smaller than the maximum H/P time (#3025). If the delay time is set too high, it
  might take very long time for DHW heating.
- Temperature difference determining the booster heater OFF temperature (T_BH OFF = Tu + #3033) :
  FSV #3033, Default 0°C, Range : 0 ~ 4°C.
- Temperature difference determining the booster heater ON temperature (T_BH ON = T_BH OFF - 2)

Heat Pump Variables for Space Heating

- FSV #4011 for DHW priority is set to "0(DHW)" (Default) as a default. Space heating gets a priority by
  setting FSV #4011 "1", but this is only valid when the outdoor temperature is lower than the specified
  temperature defined by FSV #4012.
- Cold weather compensation is applied when the space heating gets a priority (FSV #4011=1). It is due
  to position of heating coil and booster heater in the water tank. Heating coil is at the bottom part of
  the water tank and the booster heater is located at the middle part of the tank. So the heating coil is
  efficient to heat the whole water in the tank. Chances that hot water flows through the heating coil
  decrease with the space heating priority. And lower part of water in the tank might not get enough heat
  with the booster heater.
- Space heating off temperature(FSV #4013, Default "35/45°C", Range 10 ~ 35/45°C): At high outdoor
  temperature above this value, the space heating will be turned off, to avoid overheating.

Backup Heater Variables for Space Heating

- The FSV #4021 should be set to 1(Yes) to use 2-stage electric backup heater in hydro unit as an
  additional heat source. (If FSV # 4021 is 2, a 1-stage electic backup heater is used)
- To compensate the lowered heat pump heating performance under very cold weather conditions, the
  FSV #4023 should be set to "1(On)"(Default).
  ‒ The threshold temperature to use backup heater for cold weather compensation: FSV #4024, Default
  "0°C", Range -25 ~ 35°C
  ‒ The backup heater operation is restricted to save energy in the threshold temperature range.
- The FSV #4022 for backup heater priority should be set to "0 (both)" (Default) or "1" (backup) to use
  backup heater. If not (booster heater priority), the backup heater can be operated in case of no booster
  heater demand.
- The threshold temperature for backup heater operation during defrost mode to prevent cold draft
  because of chilled water can be controlled by adjusting FSV #4025. Under FSV #4025 of water outlet
  temperature, backup heater Will be turned on.

```
NOTE
```

- To use both heaters together at the same time, please check the capacity of the power circuit breaker of
  your house before use.

External Backup Boiler for Space Heating (Field Option)

- The FSV #4031 should be set to "1 (Yes)" to use a backup boiler as an additional heat source.
  (default: "0 (No installation)")
- Priority of backup boiler and heat pump is defined by FSV #4032 (default: "0 (OFF)")
- To compensate the lowered heat pump heating performance under very cold weather conditions, the
  backup boiler operates instead of heat pump under the threshold temperature (FSV #4033, Default
  "-15°C", Range -20 ~ 5°C).

Appendix

Maintenance activities

- In order to ensure optimal availability of the unit, a number of checks and inspections on the unit and
  the field wiring have to be carried out at regular intervals, preferably yearly.
  This maintenance should be carried out by SAMSUNG local technician. Besides keeping the remote
  controller clean by means of a soft damp cloth, no maintenance is required by the operator.

```
WARNING
```

- During longer periods of standstill, e.g. during summer with a heating only application, it is very
  important NOT TO SWITCH OFF THE POWER SUPPLY towards the unit.
- Switching off the power supply stops the automatic repetitive movement of the motor in order to
  prevent it from getting jammed.

Emergency heating / Emergency hot water supply

```
<Emergency heating_(when using #4021)>
```

- Heating function is performed only by the backup heater if the outdoor unit malfunctions (available only
  when a backup heater is connected).
- Enabling the function : Turn off the Control kit Dip S/W #1, and then turn the power off and on.
- Disabling the function : Turn on the Control kit Dip S/W #1, and then turn the power off and on.
- Default operation : Automatic heating is performed at a set temperature of 45°C.
