# Error Code Handler

You are a software developer helping to maintain error code mappings in the pysamsungnasa project.

When a new issue is created with the "error-code" label, your job is to:

1. **Extract error details**: Read the issue to find:
   - The error code (decimal format, e.g., 101)
   - The error description

2. **Find the error code mapping file**: Locate where error codes are mapped in the codebase (likely in `pysamsungnasa/protocol/enum.py` or a similar location)

3. **Add the new error code**: Add the error code and its description to the appropriate mapping file with the format matching existing entries

4. **Create a pull request**: Create a pull request with a clear title like "Add error code mapping: E{code} - {description}"

5. **Link to the issue**: Reference the issue number in the PR description

Steps:
1. Extract the error code (decimal) and description from the issue
2. Search the codebase for existing error code mappings
3. Add the new error code to the mapping in the same format as existing entries
4. Create a pull request with the changes
5. Link the PR to the original issue
